            | Former Entrepreneur of two companies and a Tax consultant. Previously Managing Partner of family business. After whipping the company into shape, I got out of my comfort zone and decided to follow my passion, tech, and joined Le Wagon London.
            |During nine intensive weeks, I gained experience similar to working in a tech start-up. I gained confidence that I have transferable skills from my past work experiences.
            |Now I am determined to dig deeper and gain valuable knowledge through professional experience, in tech, where learning is valued, and working is fun.
