  "description": "In my final project, I used React to create a client for an existing school database REST API (that I created in a previous project). The full-stack application will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific class, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.In addition, the project will require users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database. Implementing these features will push pushed React skills to new heights.To complete this project, I'll use my knowledge of React, JSX, React Router, React Context API, and Create React App.",

I request a JSON object from the API and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.",
